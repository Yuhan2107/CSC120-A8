- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
    In library class, I overloaded the methods "addTitle" and "containsTitle" by adding author to their keys. The reason is there are many books sharing the same name, so if we can find it with author name, the accuracy will largely increase.

    In the cafe class, I decided to overload both the "sellCoffee" and "restock" by only change the ounce of coffee in the cafe. This is because some one might prefer a coffee without any sugar and cream, so both of them are not necesarry to be subtracted per cup of coffee that are sold, and since coffee is very important and decreasing fastest in four of the ingradients, we might need a method only replenish the coffee.

    For the house class, I overloaded both "moveIn" and "moveOut" methods by changing the parameter to an arraylist instead of a single students, in resposible for there might be a large scale residents changing especially during the beginning and the end of the semester. In this way, adding/deleting a single student might be so tedious and low-efficient.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I found a new method that can compile to arraylist together which is ".addAll()" (or ".removeAll()"). It works similar with the ".add()" ("remove()") methods but the parameters are arraylist. This offers many conveniency when data can be sort in groups or has some patterns in it.
